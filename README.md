## Project Description
This deep learning project leverages the CelebA dataset to address two major tasks: image classification and style transfer. For **Task 1: Image Classification**, we implemented a customized Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) alongside a pretrained InceptionV3 model to classify images based on various attributes. The customized CNN demonstrated higher accuracy and F1 scores, while InceptionV3 offered faster training times. **Task 2: Style Transfer** involved using a customized CycleGAN and a pretrained VGG-19 model to transfer artistic styles between images. The application of style transfer was further showcased through a Streamlit interface, providing an interactive user experience. This project highlights the versatility and effectiveness of combining customized and pretrained models in solving complex image processing tasks.

## [Dataset Overview](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jessicali9530/celeba-dataset)
The CelebFaces Attributes (CelebA) includes both tabular data and image data. The dataset contains a total of 202,599 images. There are 40 binary attribute columns associated with these images. 

## Implemented Models and Results
Please refer to the Python files for the implementation of each model and review the slides for a comprehensive overview.
